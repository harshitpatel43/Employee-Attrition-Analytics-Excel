## Key Insights & Analysis
The "Mid-Career" Crisis: Attrition peaks sharply in the 28-37 age group, with approximately 115 departures.
Education Impact: Employees from Life Sciences (606) and Medical (464) fields account for the highest volume of turnover.

The Engine: Relied on Pivot Tables to aggregate multi-dimensional data across thousands of rows instantly.
Data Visualization: Utilized Line Charts, Donut Charts, and Horizontal Bar Charts for multivariate analysis.
Advanced Logic: Implemented XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and Dynamic Slicers to allow for real-time data drilling.
